# Joke-Generation

A project that I created with two clasmmates for my postgraduate, more precisely, the course of Natural Language Processing (NLP).  

# Objective

Generate jokes and classify them to predifined categories.

# Solution

In order to implement our objective, we had to solve two tasks: 1) <b>joke generation</b> and 2) <b>joke classification</b>

<h3> Joke generation </h3>

<ul> <li> LSTM </li> </ul>

<h3> Joke classifiaction </h3>

<ul> <li> Logistic regression </li> </ul>

# Files

<ul>
  <li> data -> Contains the jokes datasets </li>
  <li> preprocessing -> Contains the code that preprocess the jokes datasets </li>
  <li> generation -> Contains the code that creates the LSTM, which generates the new jokes </li>
  <li> classification -> Contains the code that creates the logistic regression model, which classifies the generated jokes to categories </li>

</ul>
